# Tesla-Stock-Analysis
This project is a simple stock price analysis of Tesla (TSLA) using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The main goal was to understand the historical trends in Tesla’s stock data and build a basic classification model to predict whether the stock price will go up the next day.

The notebook includes:
	•	Loading and cleaning stock data from a CSV file
	•	Date processing, where I extracted day, month, and year from the date column
	•	Feature engineering, where I created new columns like open-close and low-high to capture market behavior
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis using plots like histograms and bar charts
	•	Model building using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the next day’s price movement
	•	Evaluation of model performance using AUC score and confusion matrix
